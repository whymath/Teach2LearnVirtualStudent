# Teach2Learn Virtual Student

This is an LLM-based virtual student peer by Yohan Mathew and Jerry Chiang. Leveraging a learning by teaching approach, the virtual student's goal is to help the user learn through teaching someone else.

It was built using LangChain + Chainlit, and the live application can be found on HuggingFace [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ymath/Teach2LearnVirtualStudent).
